# Project Milestone 2 : ada-2021-project-warriors

## Abstract
This paper reports the differences between left and right wing ideologies. They have distinct, and to an extent, contradictory opinions and even have different priorities. However, do their quotes reflect these fundamental disagreements? 
We suggest clustering politicians based on the similarities in their quotes provided in the Quotebank to verify if we can conclude the ideology of a 
quote speaker based on a data-driven approach. Labels from speakers' political ideology on wiki data could be used as the ground truth to assess our classifier. 
Another aspect of this project is the study of the polarization throught the quotes.
Such analysis could provide readers with more insights and background on a quote/text to better understand it and its ideology.

## Research Questions
1. Does this quotes dataset show the differences and contrasts between right wing and left wing politicians ?
2. How to define a similarity between politicians ? Can we derive such a measure of similarity ?
3. According to this definition, do speakers with the same positionning show a higher level of similarity? 
4. Clustering the speakers based on this measure, do these clusters match with the ideologic left/right separation ? 
5. Through time, how the distance between these cluster evolve ? Can we relate this evolution to some major historic events ?
6. How does the politicians speech vary depending on the educational degree?

## Additional Datasets

[Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page). This database provides additional features about the politicians.

## Methods


First, as we were dealing with a huge file from Quotebank, our first objective was to filter it in order to keep only the useful data, and to have a data in a manageable size. For this purpose, we decided to remove the following features : Proba, phase, urls, etc.(non-exhaustive list). As our interest was only about politicians, we filtered out all the quotes which were not written by politicians. To do so, we used the additional dataframe Wikidata for which more details are given below. 


In order to enrich our dataset, we decided to fetch the data from the additional dataset Wikidata. The objective was to get the country, the occupation, the political party, and the academic degree of each quotationâ€™s speaker. This was maybe the most challenging part of the preprocessing, as we had to find a solution which does not lead to a huge runtime. The first option considered was to use the API of Wikidata, using the QwikiData library. Unfortunately, even tough it was a feasible solution in theory, this was leading to unfeasible runtime (many hours). The second option (also not feasible) was based on a merge of the data frames ( from Wikidata and QuoteBank).  The third (and last) one was based on the observation that qIDs were unique values, and could then be considered as an index. We then kept only the politicians, as it was the only need of our topic. That way, this enabled to filter out the quotes which were not related to a politician, as mentioned above. Other difficulties were met, namely when finding many ids for one speaker. In order to fix that, we considered only the first id. 
  

Finally, in order to get a better understanding of the data, we decided to do some visualisation. We started to plot the distribution of the political parties over the speakers, along with some ratios. For example, we found the percentage of Americans and non Americans politicians in our data, which reinforced our choice of studying politicians in the USA.

Having the preprocessing step done, we will now use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract information from the quotes.  After this, we will cluster the quotes in order to see if we get different clusters for left and right wings or, on the contrary, if we discover that there is no real difference between these ideologies.


## Timeline 
* 19 novembre : Exxplore the different NLP techniques and choose a similarity metric based on that.
* 26 novembre : Apply the NLP and the clustering.
* 3 decembre : Distance evolution through time between these cluster.
* 10 decembre  : Educational degree analysis.
* 15 decembre : Internal deadline, feedback and last updates.

## Team Organization 

We do most of the work as a team but we still defined some tasks manager: 
* Aya Rahmoun :  NLP techniques explorations, and NLP Analysis.
* Abdeslam Guessous : Clustering after having defined the appropriate similarity measure. 
* Louay Najar : Analysis of evolution trough time and comparison to events.
* Mortadha Abderrahim : NLP Implementation and general review.
